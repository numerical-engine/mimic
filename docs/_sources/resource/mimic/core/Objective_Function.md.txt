### Objective_Function
```{eval-rst}  
.. automodule:: mimic.core.Objective_Function
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
```
```{note}
Any objective function should be defined by classes inheriting this module, because forward method isn't implemented.
Codes in `./mimic/Benchmark/` will help you.
